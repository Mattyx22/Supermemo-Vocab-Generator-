By this simple javascript app you can easily create vocab bank to learn

Supermemo Vocab Generator is a simple app which you can open in your browser to create own vocab bank for supermemo app.
I made it for my own needs, but I decided to publish it here. :) Maybe it'll be helpful for somebody.

HOW TO USE IT?
At first you have to give information about the number of words you want to use in a file. 
Then you just write words in your native language and the translation to language that you're learning.
Then just click send and it'll generate some text which you can copy to notepad and save as a .txt file. 

After creating file you can send it to your smartphone and using supermemo app (from google store) you're able to import your vocab bank
there.
